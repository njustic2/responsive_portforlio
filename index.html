      <img src="assets/images/nate.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="NATHAN">

      <p>Hello, generally I like to help people. I travel a lot, love food and I like to meet people as well. I love education and hence I take lots of courses and do plenty of online stuff. I love family and friends and I support making the family and friends a better one&eacute; I am athletic and a good sportsman. I train at least once in a week either at the gym or at the park. I also ride my bike whenever i have the time to do so. I play golf, not a pro or such, but it makes me happy. I also play lawn tennis. I like watching movies and I sometimes like enjoying the&nbsp;scenery.</p>

      <p>So, there you are, I have told you who i am, what I like and what I do. To wrap up, I am a computer guy. As much as I like to program and code, I still do not like the vast array of programming language. They are just too much to know and too plenty to learn. I belive in mastering a particular programing language, however, the industrty does not let you do that successfully.
</p>
